!["The Great Beyond" by Lars Pauwels](%talc:asset:imgs/great-beyond.png%)

> The above image is a cropped version of "[The Great Beyond](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/02/desktop-wallpaper-calendars-march-2018/#the-great-beyond)" by Lars Pauwels which I first saw in the [March 2018 Smashing Magazine wallpaper post](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/02/desktop-wallpaper-calendars-march-2018)

One thing that's always bugged me about my toy project Talc, which powers this blog, is that it didn't handle static assets like pictures, videos, etc. So during my parental leave, I took some of my downtime (of which there was very little `:-D`) to try and add static assets. The image I've added at the top here is the first static asset I've tried to add to a page.
